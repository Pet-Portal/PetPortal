Final project of Ironhack Bootcamp!

After 6 months Juan Berrondo and I (Alejandro Puerta) developed our final Bootcamp project.

Pet Portal is a app in order to look for someone to take care of your pets! Or maybe you would like to look after the pet of someone else!

The app is based in an Express API and a ReactJS front-end web. MongoDB was our motor database.

We used some libraries like mongoose, passport, cors, nodemailer, multer-storage, express-session, moment and much more!
